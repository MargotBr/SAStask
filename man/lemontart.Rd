\description{
In the 'lemon tart recipes' study, a panel of 66 participants was recruited and asked realized a Sequential Agglomerative Sorting (SAS) task. This task involved 3 subsets of 9, 9, and 9 recipes (videos). Additionally, external information about the participants was collected, such as their gender (F or M), their age bracket (-18, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55), and their culinary expertise levels (extremely.weak, weak, medium, good). Data were also supplemented by three covariates providing information about the recipes (three factors used in a complete experimental design to create the recipes).
